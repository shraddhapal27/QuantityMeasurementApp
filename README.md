### 📅 UC1 : Feet Measurement Equality
- Implements value-based equality comparison for measurements in feet using proper object-oriented design.
- Two Feet objects are considered equal if their numerical values are equal.
- Key Concepts
- Overriding equals() method
- Using Double.compare() for floating-point comparison
- Null and type safety checks
- Encapsulation and immutability
- Example: Input: 1.0 ft and 1.0 ft Output: true

### 📅 UC2 : Inch Measurement Equality
- Implements value-based equality comparison for measurements in inches.
- Two Inch objects are considered equal if their numerical values are equal.
- Key Concepts
- Overriding equals() method
- Using Double.compare() for floating-point comparison
- Null and type safety checks
- Maintaining consistency with Feet equality design
- Example: Input: 1.0 inch and 1.0 inch Output: true

### 📅 UC3 : Generic Length Class (DRY Principle)
- Refactored separate Feet and Inch classes into a single Length class.
- Introduced LengthUnit enum to represent supported measurement units.
- Eliminated code duplication by applying the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Implemented cross-unit equality comparison using conversion to a common base unit (inches).
- Maintains backward compatibility with UC1 and UC2 functionality.
- Key Concepts:
  - DRY Principle
  - Enum usage for type safety
  - Encapsulation of value and unit
  - Cross-unit comparison logic
  - Proper equals() and hashCode() implementation
- Example: Input: Length(1.0, FEET) and Length(12.0, INCHES) Output: true
