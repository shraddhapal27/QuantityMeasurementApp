### 📅 UC1 : Feet Measurement Equality
- Implements value-based equality comparison for measurements in feet using proper object-oriented design.
- Two Feet objects are considered equal if their numerical values are equal.
- Key Concepts
- Overriding equals() method
- Using Double.compare() for floating-point comparison
- Null and type safety checks
- Encapsulation and immutability
- Example: Input: 1.0 ft and 1.0 ft Output: true

### 📅 UC2 : Inch Measurement Equality
- Implements value-based equality comparison for measurements in inches.
- Two Inch objects are considered equal if their numerical values are equal.
- Key Concepts
- Overriding equals() method
- Using Double.compare() for floating-point comparison
- Null and type safety checks
- Maintaining consistency with Feet equality design
- Example: Input: 1.0 inch and 1.0 inch Output: true

### 📅 UC3 : Generic Length Class (DRY Principle)
- Refactored separate Feet and Inch classes into a single Length class.
- Introduced LengthUnit enum to represent supported measurement units.
- Eliminated code duplication by applying the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Implemented cross-unit equality comparison using conversion to a common base unit (inches).
- Maintains backward compatibility with UC1 and UC2 functionality.
- Key Concepts:
  - DRY Principle
  - Enum usage for type safety
  - Encapsulation of value and unit
  - Cross-unit comparison logic
  - Proper equals() and hashCode() implementation
- Example: Input: Length(1.0, FEET) and Length(12.0, INCHES) Output: true

### 📅 UC4 : Extended Length Units Support - YARD, CENTIMETER
- Extended the generic Length class to support additional measurement units: YARD and CENTIMETER.
- Updated LengthUnit enum with the new units and their conversion factors.
- Maintained DRY principle—no duplicate logic for new units.
- Ensured cross-unit equality comparison works for all supported units (FEET, INCHES, YARD, CENTIMETER).
- Backward compatible: all UC1, UC2, and UC3 functionality remains intact.
- Key Concepts:
 - Enum extension for type-safe new units
 - Conversion logic for added units
 - Cross-unit comparison across all length units
 - Proper equals() and hashCode() handling for extended units
- Example: Input: Length(3.0, FEET) and Length(1.0, YARD) Output: true

### 📅 UC5 : Length Unit Conversion API
- Extended Length class to provide explicit conversion between all supported units (FEET, INCHES, YARDS, CENTIMETERS).
- Added Length.convert(value, sourceUnit, targetUnit) and Length.convertTo(targetUnit) for instance conversions.
- Maintained DRY principle with base unit normalization.
- Backward compatible with all UC1–UC4 functionality.
- Key Concepts:
 - Enum-based conversion factors for type safety
 - Cross-unit conversions with proper precision
 - Immutability and value-object semantics
 - Input validation for null, NaN, and infinite values
 - Overloaded conversion methods for flexibility

### 📅 UC6 : Length Unit Conversion API (UC5 → UC6 Enhancement)
- Extended Length class to provide explicit conversion between any supported units (FEET, INCHES, YARDS, CENTIMETERS).
- Introduced:
 - Length.convert(value, sourceUnit, targetUnit) – static method for raw numeric conversion.
 - length.convertTo(targetUnit) – instance method to convert an existing Length object.
 - Input validation ensures null, NaN, and infinite values are handled safely.
 - Maintains DRY principle, immutability, and backward compatibility with UC1–UC5.
- Key Concepts:
 - Cross-unit conversion via base-unit normalization
 - Enum-based type-safe conversion factors
 - Precision handling using epsilon tolerance
 - Overloaded conversion methods for flexible API usage
